# Bike Rental Demand Prediction (PRCP-1018)

## Overview
This project analyzes bike rental data to understand usage patterns and predict daily bike rental demand based on environmental and seasonal factors.

## Dataset
The dataset contains hourly and daily bike rental records along with weather conditions, seasonal information, and user categories (casual and registered).

## Approach
- Data loading and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature analysis and correlation study
- Model building and comparison
- Demand prediction

## Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

## Best Model
Random Forest showed the best performance by capturing non-linear relationships between weather conditions and rental demand.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
